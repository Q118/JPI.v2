In order to provide the best possible training experience, Corelation Technical Trainers require good communication from all course attendees to ensure a timely delivery of class materials and provide clear guidelines for course details and expectations. If an attendee does not respond to emailed requests to complete action items within 4 days prior to the start of a course, Technical Trainers reserve the right to cancel the attendee's enrollment for that particular class. Cancellation fees may apply.
